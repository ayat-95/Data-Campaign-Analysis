### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Marketing data to extract valuable insights that can inform business decision-making. It involves identifying sales trends, top-selling products, and key revenue metrics.
 In "Sales Data Analysis," I worked with a substantial sales dataset to explore various aspects of the business.
 l analyze sales trends over time, determine which products are top sellers, calculate essential revenue metrics like total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to effectively communicate my findings.
